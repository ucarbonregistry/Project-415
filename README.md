0.27 MW Captive Solar Power Project ZIPL, Gujarat, India
The project 0.27 MW Captive Solar Power Project ZIPL, Gujarat, India is located in Village
Matoda, Taluka Sanand, District Ahmedabad, State Gujarat, Country India.

The details of the registered project are as follows:
This is a single project activity of total installed capacity 0.27 MW, which is a ground mounted
captive solar power generation activity for captive use by M/s Zydus Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (ZIPL,
Project Proponent or PP). Zydus Cadila, group of companies, is a fully integrated global healthcare
and pharmaceutical provider, which has set up a Pharmaceutical Special Economy Zone (SEZ)
called “Pharmez”, about 25 kilometers from Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The Zydus group has undertaken
focused efforts towards solar energy, water and wastewater recycling and reuse across all of its
operations in India.

The PP has the full ownership of the project activity. This project is an operational activity with
continuous reduction of GHGs, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR),
which rewards solar programs with carbon credits as an incentive for positive climate action in the
Global South, as opposed to carbon finance in other international voluntary carbon programs.
It is now widely acknowledged that global efforts must accelerate clean technology adoption by
2030 to avert irreversible climate catastrophe. Carbon incentive policies, exemplified by programs
like the UCR CoU, will play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. India has set ambitious targets:
450 GW of renewable energy capacity and 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. With 110
GW already operational (as of 2021-22), the country must add 340 GW of new renewable energy
capacity over the next eight years (equivalent to an average of 42.5 GW annually). This substantial
expansion is crucial for addressing climate change and providing hope to the world. To achieve this,
India’s solar capacity needs to increase fivefold, reaching 280 GW from the current 54 GW. This
translates to an average annual addition of 29 GW of new solar capacity until the end of this decade
– a pace significantly faster than the nation’s previous record of 15 GW renewable energy
(including 14 GW of solar and 1 GW of wind) added in fiscal year 2021-22.

Purpose of the project activity:
The objective of the proposed project is to produce electricity through a sustainable and renewable
energy source: solar radiation. Specifically, the project involves setting up and operating a 0.27 MW
solar power plant in Sanand Taluka, located in the state of Gujarat:

Commissioning date Matoda Sanand ground mounted - Captive 20.01.2019

Based on the ex-ante estimate, this project is expected to produce approximately 340 MWh of
renewable electricity annually, assuming an average PLF (Plant Load Factor) of 14.39%. The
project employs Polycrystalline solar photovoltaic technology to generate environmentally friendly
energy.

Solar photovoltaic power generation is inherently clean, as it does not involve the combustion of
fossil fuels or the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). A photovoltaic module comprises
interconnected photovoltaic cells encased in an environmentally protective laminate. These modules
serve as the fundamental building blocks of a complete PV (photovoltaic) generating unit. When
multiple PV panels are mounted on a frame, they form what is known as a PV Array. By displacing
fossil fuel-based electricity generation in the regional grid, this project contributes to reducing GHG
emissions.
